           <summary><strong>What is the Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)?</strong></summary>
           <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/fare-subsidy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168263309&amp;usg=AOvVaw15kwCMmex5r8kWnix9KWZX">Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)</a> is a pilot program offering discounts on metro and bus. Through a lottery, we&ndash;DC Government&ndash;will give up to 2,000 residents half-price discounts or free unlimited trips for nine months. If you&rsquo;re eligible and you <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.beta.dc.gov/s3/LIFT-Online-Sign-Up-Form&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168263759&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qawfo3abmOQJ2bvGsjJqa">apply</a> , you&rsquo;ll get one of the following:</p>

    <details>
            <summary><strong>Why is DC Government offering the discounts by lottery?</strong></summary>
            <p>There are more eligible individuals than we have funding for in the pilot, and a lottery gives everyone a fair chance of getting a discount. We&rsquo;ll also be able to use this lottery to inform a study, called a <a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/randomized-evaluation&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168264473&amp;usg=AOvVaw1mDRTmzHtjmrLZ5Me2H5kB">randomized evaluation</a>, that will help us see if LIFT &nbsp;actually impacts the way residents get around and their employment, income, family, health, and energy use.(Learn <a href="#id.dataprotection">how we&rsquo;ll protect participants&rsquo; data</a> .) The findings may help us make transit more affordable and encourage transit use in DC.</p>

                <li>Your household gets help paying for your utilities from the Department of Energy &amp; Environment (DOEE) or has in the past year. This means you received assistance from one or more of the following programs anytime since October 2020: </li>
    <ul>

    </ul>
      <li>You&rsquo;re not personally receiving a senior, student, or disability discount on transit including the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168266964&amp;usg=AOvVaw05p3YDE38-hLEME7S2U3bZ">Free or Reduced Fare Program</a> for seniors and people with disabilities, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ddot.dc.gov/page/kids-ride-free-program&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168267163&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OSDUuKmYFlr3tImJxQ93C">Kids Ride Free</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ddot.dc.gov/page/adult-learner-transit-subsidy-program-faqs&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168267366&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yY99rXCuBPbO7BSRA-gsZ">Adult Learner Transit Subsidy</a>. It&rsquo;s okay if someone else in your household is receiving one of these discounts.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Why do I need to be receiving utility assistance from DOEE to sign up for this program?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Because LIFT is a temporary pilot, it has limited slots. The findings from LIFT can be used to shape future policies and programs that make transit more affordable for low-income residents, not just DOEE customers.</li>
      <li>We also want to make it as easy as possible to sign-up. DOEE already verifies income for households receiving utility assistance, so households in LIFT will not need to verify their income again. In this way, we&rsquo;ll decrease the paperwork you&rsquo;ll need to enter the lottery.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Can more than one person in my household enter the lottery?</strong></summary>
        <pr>Only one member per household can sign up for LIFT.</p>
