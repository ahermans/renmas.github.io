       <details>
           <summary><strong>What is the Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)?</strong></summary>
           <p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/fare-subsidy&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168263309&amp;usg=AOvVaw15kwCMmex5r8kWnix9KWZX">Low-Income Fare Trial (LIFT)</a> is a pilot program offering discounts on metro and bus. Through a lottery, we&ndash;DC Government&ndash;will give up to 2,000 residents half-price discounts or free unlimited trips for nine months. If you&rsquo;re eligible and you <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forms.beta.dc.gov/s3/LIFT-Online-Sign-Up-Form&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168263759&amp;usg=AOvVaw2qawfo3abmOQJ2bvGsjJqa">apply</a> , you&rsquo;ll get one of the following:</p>

    <details>
            <summary><strong>Why is DC Government offering the discounts by lottery?</strong></summary>
            <p>There are more eligible individuals than we have funding for in the pilot, and a lottery gives everyone a fair chance of getting a discount. We&rsquo;ll also be able to use this lottery to inform a study, called a <a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thelabprojects.dc.gov/randomized-evaluation&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168264473&amp;usg=AOvVaw1mDRTmzHtjmrLZ5Me2H5kB">randomized evaluation</a>, that will help us see if LIFT &nbsp;actually impacts the way residents get around and their employment, income, family, health, and energy use.(Learn <a href="#id.dataprotection">how we&rsquo;ll protect participants&rsquo; data</a> .) The findings may help us make transit more affordable and encourage transit use in DC.</p>

                <li>You live in the District of Columbia.</li>
                <li>You&rsquo;re between 18-64 years old.</li>
                <li>Your household gets help paying for your utilities from the Department of Energy &amp; Environment (DOEE) or has in the past year. This means you received assistance from one or more of the following programs anytime since October 2020: </li>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.frontdoor.dc.gov/liheap-and-udp&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168265764&amp;usg=AOvVaw1aQ62ITx0Tae4T6DBubS4E">Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)</a> </li>

    </ul>
      <li>You&rsquo;re not personally receiving a senior, student, or disability discount on transit including the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wmata.com/fares/reduced.cfm&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168266964&amp;usg=AOvVaw05p3YDE38-hLEME7S2U3bZ">Free or Reduced Fare Program</a> for seniors and people with disabilities, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ddot.dc.gov/page/kids-ride-free-program&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168267163&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OSDUuKmYFlr3tImJxQ93C">Kids Ride Free</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ddot.dc.gov/page/adult-learner-transit-subsidy-program-faqs&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1647026168267366&amp;usg=AOvVaw3yY99rXCuBPbO7BSRA-gsZ">Adult Learner Transit Subsidy</a>. It&rsquo;s okay if someone else in your household is receiving one of these discounts.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Why do I need to be receiving utility assistance from DOEE to sign up for this program?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Because LIFT is a temporary pilot, it has limited slots. The findings from LIFT can be used to shape future policies and programs that make transit more affordable for low-income residents, not just DOEE customers.</li>
      <li>We also want to make it as easy as possible to sign-up. DOEE already verifies income for households receiving utility assistance, so households in LIFT will not need to verify their income again. In this way, we&rsquo;ll decrease the paperwork you&rsquo;ll need to enter the lottery.</li>
    </ul>
    </details><br>
    <details>
            <summary><strong>Can more than one person in my household enter the lottery?</strong></summary>
        <pr>Only one member per household can sign up for LIFT.</p>

            <summary><strong>Am I allowed to participate in other DC Government programs during LIFT?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Your participation in LIFT does not affect the benefits and services you would normally receive from DOEE or other District agencies, but you are not eligible for LIFT if you personally receive a senior, disability, or student discount on metro or bus. That includes the Free or Reduced Fare Program for seniors and people with disabilities or the Kids Ride Free and Adult Learner Transit Subsidy for students.</li>

            <summary><strong>How will DC Government use my information?</strong></summary>
    <ul>
      <li>In addition to providing transit discounts to residents, this program will also help us&ndash; DC Government &ndash;learn how these transit discounts affect how residents get around, as well as their employment, income, family, health, and energy use. Along with everyone else who enters the lottery, we&rsquo;ll look at the number and type of trips you take on transit to learn how the discounts impact the way you get around. We will ask you to answer optional surveys, and you&rsquo;ll be paid for your time. We may look at existing data from DC government and credit reporting agencies to see whether the discounts impact your employment, income, children&rsquo;s outcomes, and use of healthcare and social services. All your records will remain confidential.</li>
